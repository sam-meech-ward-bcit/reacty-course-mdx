## Overview

<Instruction>
  Use the following github classroom link to setup your teams and push your code.
</Instruction>

[https://classroom.github.com/a/kmMqADBC](https://classroom.github.com/a/kmMqADBC)

This will be a single Next app repo. 

## Using Not Next

Choose a modern front end framework that is not react and build out the front end functionality for your application

* Setup everything that you have designed and planned for your application
* Add a README.md explaining how to run the project in a dev environment
* Follow your framework's best/common practices for structuring your code
* Deploy your application and share your url in discord 


All of the frontend functionality should be built out. This app should work and be bug free and the code should be not a tire fire. Grading will be totally subjective based on how good of a job i think you did. 

100% on this assignment would mean: 

* The code is clean and well structured
* The app works and is bug free
* Styles are done well and corners weren't cut

You will also present your app to the rest of the class and talk a little bit about how your framework compares to react. 


## Using Next


### Next App (50%)

* Setup tailwind, storybook, and prisma correctly
* Add a README.md explaining how to run the project in a dev environment
* Use any suggested next features like `Link`, and `Image`
* Follow next and react best practices

### Storybook (50%)

* Create a storybook story for each of your components that aren't pages. Each component should have it's own:
  * Controls
  * Actions
  * Interactions

There should be at least 10 components, but you can create as many as you like.

### Database (50%)

Use Prisma To:

* Create a database schema
* Create database migrations
* Generate Prisma Client
* Create a seed script

Your database schema should follow best practices, so relational databases should be normalized and then denormalized for effeciency. NoSQL databases should be store their data based on your application's **access patterns**.

### Server (50%)

* Any AJAX requests should be made directly to the next server API that can make connections to the database.
* Any data fetching that happens when the page initially loads should **NOT** go through the API. The page should connect directly to the database using `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`.
