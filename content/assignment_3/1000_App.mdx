You're kind of just building this app. For now, just hard code a single user into the app. You will add user auth later.

This assignment is due Nov 10th at 11:59pm.

## 1) Prisma

Setup all of the models and relationships for the entities in the README file. 

## 2) Create a post 

* Add a button to the home page that says "Create a post" and takes you to a page where you can create a post.
* When the user submits a post, it should send the data to the server and create a new post in the database.

## 3) Get all posts on the home page

When the user goes to the home page, it should fetch all of the posts from the database and display them on the page.

We're going to assume that the posts are constantly changing and could take a while to load, so instead of doing SSR for the list of posts, do the following:

* When the page loads, show a loading indicator
* use `swr`, **or** `useEffect` to fetch the posts over an AJAX request and display them on the home page. 

The post should show the user who created them. You will need to `include` the user in the query.

## 4) View a single post and comments

When a user clicks on a single post, it should take them to a page that shows the post and all of the comments for that post.

* use `getStaticProps` to load the post 
* use `swr`, **or** `useEffect` to fetch the comments for the post. 

The post and the comments should show the user who created them. You will need to `include` the user in the query.

## 5) Create a comment

Allow a user to create a new comment on a post. This will increment the comment count for that post. 

## 6) Like/Unlike post

Allow a user to like and unlike a post. This will increment or decrement the like count for that post. 

Clicking the like button will toggle the like on and off.

## 7) User Profile Page 

Create a profile page at `/profile` that shows the user's posts and comments.

## 8) Add user auth (lab)

Add user auth to the app using next auth.

* 15% Add github login
* 15% Add google login (probably leave this until the end)
* 15% Add the user auth nav bar functionality
  * Show the avatar in the nav bar 
  * Allow the user to sign out from the nav bar
  * Allow the user to sign in from the nav bar 
* 15% Don't allow a user to create a post unless they are logged in. 
* 15% Create a logical flow for a user to sign in and then create a post. (restrict access to the create post page, or have them sign in when they hit the submit button)
* 15% Save the logged in user to the database using the prisma adapter 
* 10% Create a one-to-many relatioinship between the user and the other entities: 
  - post
  - comment
  - like
