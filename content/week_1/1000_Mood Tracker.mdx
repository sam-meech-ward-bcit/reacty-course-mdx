# Mood Tracker

## Overview

In this assignment, you will create a mood tracker that allows users input a rating of their mood on a scale of 1-10, and a note about their current mood. This will end up being a complete CRUD app so users can create, read, update, and delete their moods. They will also be able to see a list of all of their moods and sort by date or rating.
