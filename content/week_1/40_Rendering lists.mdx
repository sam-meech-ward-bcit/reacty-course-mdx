Rendering a List of Components

<YouTube videoId="f640Z6QZawc"></YouTube>

<br />

```jsx
jokes.map(joke => (
  <Joke key={joke.id} joke={joke.joke} rating={joke.rating} />
))
```

Using map like this is super common in React. You need to know how this code works and how to use it.


A component can be stored in an array and we can just dump the array of components into jsx and it will render them:


```js
const jokes = [
  {
    id: 1,
    joke: "What do you call a cow with no legs?",
    rating: 4,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    joke: "What do you call a cow with two legs?",
    rating: 3,
  }
]

const jokesComponents = [
  <Joke joke={joke.joke} rating={joke.rating} />,
  <Joke joke={joke.joke} rating={joke.rating} />
]

return (
  <div>
    {jokesComponents}
  </div>
)
```

But this is a very hard coded brute force approach, let's make it a little bit more dynamic

## For Loop

One way of making this dynamic is to use a normal for loop:

```js
const jokesComponents = []
for (let i = 0; i < jokes.length; i++) {
  const joke = jokes[i]
  jokesComponents.push(<Joke joke={joke.joke} rating={joke.rating} />)
}
```

But since we're just creating a new array, we can use the map function instead:

## Map

```js
const jokesComponents = jokes.map(joke => (
  <Joke joke={joke.joke} rating={joke.rating} />
))
```

And map is the preferred way of doing this.

## Keys

We just need to make sure we include a key for each component in the array:

```js
const jokesComponents = jokes.map(joke => (
  <Joke key={joke.id} joke={joke.joke} rating={joke.rating} />
))
```
