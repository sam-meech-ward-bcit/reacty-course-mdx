For this lab, we will be creating a simple todo list app (excuse the lack of css):


http://comp3330-todos-1.s3-website.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/



## Setup

<Instruction>
Use Vite to create a new React app called `Todos`.
</Instruction>

## Show Todos 20%

<Instruction>
Create an array of todos that will be stored in state in App.jsx. 
</Instruction>

Each todo should have an `id`, `title` and a `completed` property. The `completed` property should be a boolean that is `false` by default. Start by adding two or three default todos, we'll add more using a form later.

**Example:**

```jsx
const [todos, setTodos] = useState([{
  id: 1,
  title: 'Learn React',
  completed: false
}, {
  id: 2,
  title: 'Learn Vue',
  completed: false
}, {
  id: 3,
  title: 'Learn Angular',
  completed: false
}])
```

<Instruction>
Create a `Todo` component and use `map` to display all of the todos using this component. 
</Instruction>

This component doesn't need to manage state, it just needs to display the todo's title and completed status. 

It will also need two buttons: one to mark the todo as completed and one to delete the todo.

## Delete Todo 15%

<Instruction>
Implement the delete todo logic.
</Instruction>

When the delete button is clicked, the todo should be removed from the todos array. So App will need to pass a function to Todo that will remove the todo from the todos array.

## Complete Todo 15%

<Instruction>
Implement the complete todo logic.
</Instruction>

When the complete button is clicked, the todo's `completed` property should be set to `true`. So App will need to pass a function to Todo that will update the todo's `completed` property.

## Add Todo 20%


<Instruction>
Create a new component called `TodoForm` that will be a form with a single input and a submit button and display it at the top of the page.
</Instruction>

<Instruction>
When a user submits the form, add the new todo to the todos array.
</Instruction>

The form should send the title of the todo to App. Since we don't have a natural way of generating unique ids, use `self.crypto.randomUUID()` to generate a unique id for the todo.

```jsx
const handleAddTodo = (title) => {
  const newTodo = {
    id: self.crypto.randomUUID(),
    title,
    completed: false
  }

  // ...
}
```

## Show Form 15%

<Instruction>
Hide the form by default and show it when the user clicks a button.
</Instruction>

## useLocalStorage 15%

<Instruction>
Use a `useLocalStorage` hook instead of `useState` so that the todos get stored in the browswer
</Instruction>
